#Problem 3
#for i in range(1,4):
x=0
#this is what my x value is.
K=[]
#This is for my list, I named it K
while x <= 35:
#here is where I want to kinda defined where my list should end. so in the problem, it said that it was to make a list that ends after it hits 35.
    K.append(x)
#append lets me add a number into my current list, which starts off at zero.
    x= x + 1 #My equation that gets me to greater than 35
    print(x)
