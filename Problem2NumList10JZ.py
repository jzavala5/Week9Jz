#problem 2, while loop, making a list with it
x=0
L=[]
#This creates an empty list, so we dont need to write out 0-10 by hand.
while x <= 10:
    #my code here
    L.append(x)
#L.append allows us to add a number on the list. so it starts off at 0 and keeps adding x+1

    x = x + 1
    print(x)
#always print x in order to see the values and see what they are working.
